# PART2: "HOW ALL OF THIS IS USEFUL?" OR "MAKING IMPOSSIBLE STATES IMPOSSIBLE"

## Unions helps to structure the state with bigger precision, thus limiting invalid variations

## APIs are more readable as the structure gives you better understanding of the functionality

*Pros*
* Better APIs
* Better state management
* Encoding business rules into type system
* Making mini DSLs for control flows

*Cons*
* A bit more verbose
* Might look weird at first
* Typescript errors might be more complicated and can take some time to get used to
