# ALGEBRAIC DATA TYPES!!!!!!!!!

WIKIPEDIA:

Algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by
combining other types

Two common classes of algebraic types are product types (i.e., tuples and
records) and sum types (i.e., tagged or disjoint unions, coproduct types or
variant types).

ME: AND YOU CAN DO ALGEBRA STUFF ON THEM (LIKE IN SCHOOL)!!!

Product operator being equivalent to typescript intersection
a * b ~ A & B

Sum operator being equivalent to typescript union operator
a + b ~ A | B
