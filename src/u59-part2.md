## Unions | sum types helps to struckture the state with bigger precision, thus limiting invalid variations

## Api's are more readable as the structure gives you better understanding of the functionality

THEY HELP YOU TO TAKLE COMPLEXITY AND HAVE LESS BUGS!
The idea is not new, but not popular enought in typescript community.

Nice videos with more thorough examples in different languages but totally doable in typescript!!!!!
