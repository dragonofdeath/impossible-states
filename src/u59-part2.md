#PART2: "HOW ALL OF THIS IS USEFULL?" OR "MAKING IMPOSSIBLE STATES IMPOSSIBLE"

## Unions | sum types helps to structure the state with bigger precision, thus limiting invalid variations

## Api's are more readable as the structure gives you better understanding of the functionality

Pros
* Better API's
* Better state management
* Encoding business rules into type system
* Making mini DSL's for control flows

Cons
* A bit more verbose
* Might look weird at first
* Typescript errors might be more complicated and can take some time to get used to
