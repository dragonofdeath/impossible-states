       * The main goal of this presentation is to spread the idea expressed in
         its title. I believe that it doesn't get enough exposure compared to
         its value

       * Though there is some information about it but more in other languages,
         and very little in typescript

       * The core idea is to model your state/APIs/or any other data in a way
         it would be impossible to do a mistake while using it. As the result
         you get:
           + less variations/less complexity to think about
           + less test needed
           + less bugs
