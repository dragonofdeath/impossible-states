       * to spread the idea - it doesn't get enough exposure compared to its
         value

       * also there is information about it but more in other languages, but
         not so much in typescript

       * the core idea is to model your state/API's/or any other data in a way
         it would be impossible to do a mistake. As the result you get:
           + less variations/less complexity to think about
           + less test needed
           + less bugs
